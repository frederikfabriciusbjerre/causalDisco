\title{Order-restrict a PAG skeleton by temporal knowledge}
\usage{
order_restrict_pag_skel(amat, knowledge)
}
\arguments{
\item{amat}{A square numeric adjacency matrix in pcalg PAG format
(rows/columns named by variable names).}

\item{knowledge}{A \emph{knowledge} object that provides tier labels for variables.}
}
\value{
The modified adjacency matrix with arrowheads added at the later node
for cross-tier pairs.
}
\description{
Given a PAG adjacency matrix (with entries \code{0} = none, \code{1} = circle,
\code{2} = arrowhead, \code{3} = tail; indexed as \code{[from, to]} in the pcalg
convention), enforce temporal constraints implied by \code{knowledge}: whenever
an edge crosses tiers, place an arrowhead at the later node.
