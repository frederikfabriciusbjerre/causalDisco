\arguments{
\item{data}{A data frame with the observed variables. Columns are variables.
When using the deprecated \code{order} argument, variables should be
prefixed with their period name (see examples). When using
\code{knowledge}, prefixes are not required.}

\item{knowledge}{A \emph{knowledge} object describing tiers/periods and optional
forbidden/required edges. This replaces the legacy \code{order} interface and
is the preferred way to supply temporal background knowledge.}

\item{order}{\strong{Deprecated}. A character vector with period-prefixes in their
temporal order (e.g., \code{c("p1", "p2")}). If supplied (and \code{knowledge}
is \code{NULL}), a temporary \code{knowledge} object is constructed using
\link[tidyselect:starts_with]{tidyselect::starts_with} for each prefix. Supplying
both \code{knowledge} and \code{order} is an error.}

\item{alpha}{The alpha level used as the per-test significance
threshold for conditional independence testing.}

\item{test}{A conditional independence test. The default \code{regTest}
uses a regression-based information-loss test. Another available option is
\code{corTest} which tests for vanishing partial correlations. User-supplied
functions may also be used; see details for the required interface.}

\item{suffStat}{A sufficient statistic. If supplied, it is passed directly
to the test and no statistics are computed from \code{data}. Its structure
depends on the chosen \code{test}.}

\item{method}{Skeleton construction method, one of \code{"stable"},
\code{"original"}, or \code{"stable.fast"} (default). See
\code{\link[pcalg]{skeleton}} for details.}

\item{methodNA}{Handling of missing values, one of \code{"none"} (default;
error on any \code{NA}), \code{"cc"} (complete-case analysis), or
\code{"twd"} (test-wise deletion).}

\item{methodOri}{Method for handling conflicting separating sets when orienting
edges; must be one of \code{"standard"}, \code{"conservative"} (the default) or
\code{"maj.rule"}. See \link[pcalg]{pc} for further details.}

\item{directed_as_undirected}{Logical; if \code{TRUE}, treat any directed
edges in \code{knowledge} as undirected during skeleton learning. This
is due to the fact that \pkg{pcalg} does not allow directed edges in
\code{fixedEdges} or \code{fixedGaps}. Default is \code{FALSE}.}

\item{varnames}{Character vector of variable names. Only needed when
\code{data} is not supplied and all information is passed via
\code{suffStat}.}

\item{...}{Additional arguments passed to
\code{\link[pcalg]{skeleton}} during skeleton construction.}
}
\value{
A \code{discography} tibble with columns \code{from}, \code{to}, and
\code{edge_type}. The underlying orientation corresponds to a PAG learned by
TFCI under the supplied temporal background knowledge.
}
\description{
Use a modification of the FCI algorithm that makes use of background knowledge
in the format of a partial ordering. This may, for instance, come about when
variables can be assigned to distinct tiers or periods (i.e., a temporal ordering).
}
\details{
The temporal/tiered background information enters several places in the TFCI
algorithm: (1) In the skeleton construction phase, when looking for separating
sets \eqn{Z} between two variables \eqn{X} and \eqn{Y}, \eqn{Z} is not allowed to
contain variables that are strictly after both \eqn{X} and \eqn{Y} in the temporal
order (as specified by the \code{knowledge} tiers). (2) This also applies to the
subsequent phase where the algorithm searches for possible D-SEP sets. (3) Prior
to other orientation steps, any cross-tier edges get an arrowhead placed at their
latest node.

After this, the usual FCI orientation rules are applied; see \link[pcalg]{udag2pag}
for details.
